# Common device tree for Sony devices

This tree stores common properties shared across most sony devices and has been slightly adjusted to work with cm-13.0

Upstream merges do not have a fixed schedule but can be expected atleast once a week (if there are any changes)

This repository is planned to be merged into android_device_kitakami to make commiting simpler and less fragmented as this organization is only focused on the  Sony Kitakami platform
